Assumptions
Get the daily averages for calculations (mean and standard deviation) and not use all entries.
Ok for prefered order to be hard coded.
Ok for attributes in ProcData (and child classes) to be public. (class is used to group data together for overloading functions and parsing data)
The dates are linear and all there (ie if Janurary and March are present, so is Feburary), it is fine to start on lets say June and end on April. 
Assumes the dates are valid.
If a mean would be between 0.1 and -0.1 will just be 0
If standard deviation would be between 0.1 and 0 will just be 0

What works
Vector Class bounds checking
Vector Copy constructor
Vector = operator
Date Day checking
Date Month Checking
Date Year checking (0-3000)
Time second checking
Time Minute checking
Time hour checking (24 hour format)
Math functions
File Opening
Reading from file
Console display
File printing

What does not work
Standard Deviation does not work for last entry if only one day is recorded for the month.
Program does not work if the date is invalid
The max day is 31 if there is no month set. If the day is set to 31, then a 28/29 or 30 day month is tried to be set, it will fail.
